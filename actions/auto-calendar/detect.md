SCHEDULING DETECTION: If any text conversations contain plans to meet, appointments, or events with specific dates/times, include them in the "scheduling" field with the person's name and a brief description. This includes:
- Confirmed plans (e.g., "dinner Thursday at 7", "see you at 6")
- Proposed-but-unconfirmed plans (e.g., "does 6pm Monday work?", "how about Thursday?", "want to grab dinner this week?")
- Appointment reminders (e.g., "Your appointment with Dr. Smith is Monday at 10am")
Flag both confirmed AND proposed plans — the calendar system will determine the right action. Do NOT flag vague plans with no time reference ("let's hang soon") or obvious spam.
